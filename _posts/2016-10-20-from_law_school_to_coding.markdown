Code is everywhere. Almost every industry has restructured at least some of their functions with the continuous release and improvement of software development and the hardware derived from it. From the methods in which companies are handling internal operations, to marketing and advertising, to interacting with customers, advancements in tech have benefitted and brought revolutionary changes to the way individuals, businesses, and societies function across the globe.

As a law student and a long-time advocate for greater utilization of technology, I am often interested in not just what the law does for technology, but also what technology can do for the law. We see a lot of news on the effects of statutes and regulations on technological advancement, especially when an unconventional tool or model takes off in an important industry. While [some areas in tech enjoy a degree of legal freedom](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/11/13/government-gets-slower-tech-gets-faster-389073.html) as laws need the time to catch up with new technology, others are facing challenges that stem from existing regulations. In the last couple of years, we’ve seen the legality of companies making use of a “sharing economy,” such as Uber and Airbnb, get questioned over and over again. Google’s book-scanning project has gone through a [decade-long battle](http://www.fordhamiplj.org/2015/10/23/googles-book-scanning-is-fair-use-after-over-a-decade-of-debate) before it was deemed legally “fair use.” These hurdles provide tremendous opportunities for those who have both a technological and legal background to tackle.

The subject of what technology can do for the legal industry has less of a presence in mainstream media. In my school, considering its significance, there doesn’t seem to be enough of a discussion on this subject, except for the few related courses and professors that advocate it. It wasn’t something that crossed my mind until I began my first-year summer internships at two law firms. Despite the prestige of both law firms and the incredible amount of talent there, I noticed that a lot of the legal work was routine and repetitive. Even though I had a very basic knowledge of programming, the work seemed very “programmable.” This was especially true for the interns, trainees, and lower-level associates, whose tasks comprised mainly of briefing, citing, and organizing research data.

With further research, I learned that this isn’t a problem unique to the specific firms I worked at. [Legaltech News](http://legaltechnews.com), an online news source I’ve subscribed to for more than a year, [describes this problem](http://www.legaltechnews.com/id=1202765670209/Legal-Industry-Wake-Up-and-Smell-the-Data) as a general characteristic of the legal industry, constantly urging for legal entities to improve their practices through technology and highlights legal software that target these particular areas. [Ross](http://www.rossintelligence.com), for example, is a legal research database that utilizes IBM’s Watson computer, and is hailed as “[the world’s first artificially intelligent attorney](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/meet_ross_the_worlds_first_artificially_intelligent_attorney).” As a result, more and more law firms have caught up to trends such as striving to achieve a paperless work environment, communicating with clients through alternative means, and incorporating artificial intelligence in their legal practices.

The combination of my personal experiences and researched information inspired me to strive to be part of the solution in the legal industry. The idea really resonated with me as I read [William Ha](http://www.williamha.com)'s book, [Quit Law and Code](http://quitlawandcode.com). I began taking courses on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) last winter, to get the feeling of being a software developer. As I went along with the recommended course path, what initially was mere curiosity turned into a genuine interest and passion for coding. Rather than purely focusing on the lawyering aspect of the legal software industry, I developed a desire to immerse myself in the actual coding side of it. With a little bit of luck, I enrolled in Flatiron School’s full-stack web development program. So far, with the help of Flatiron’s kind and very responsive instructors, I’ve been enjoying the ride. I’m excited to take off into the real world soon and discover the paths I’ll be going down with these newly acquired skills.
